            <p className="text-xl mb-4 font-normal tracking-wide text-center">Because of this, it can be helpful to see some examples of what other people are doing. That way, when you create or even update your website or graphics, you will have some ideas of what to do to ensure that your design does not look or sound like it is from 1995.<br />
              <br />
              That is why we created this resource. It is a portfolio of all our track records from around the world. In addition to showcasing the gallery, each design also includes an explanation of what it is all about with links to were you can find more.<br />
              We hope we are able to give you the inspiration you need to make your decision. When you are ready, you can <a href='/about' style={{textDecoration: 'none'}}>contact us</a> and let us know of anything, which we will happily help you get it done quickly and easily.<br /><br />
